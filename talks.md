# 02.12.2022 - Swiss Reproducibility Network - Preregistration & Registered reports: how to improve the credibility and reproducibility of your research

- [Registered reports](https://cos.io/rr/) :
	- allow the method and the logic of the study to be peer-reviewed before execution
	- intro method data anlysis plan and submit stage 1 (3m) -> revision (2m) -> IPA received & data collection (2m) -> data analysis (3m) -> stage 2 (1m) -> published (3m)
- OSF to prereg + provide templates
- [OSFregistries](https://osf.io/registries) : search engine for prereg
- [aspredicted](https://aspredicted.org/) - prereg around 1-2 weeks to talk about it
- IPA : In-Principle-Acceptance
- VA : Sean because they would "typically exclude these responses" - say in the analysis that they forgot while reporting reasons why to exclude the answers
	- Prereg is not a prison - one can deviate, as long as this is clearly explained in the manuscript
- VB : Mei, as you said earlier, pre-reg does not take more time than a typical reg -
	- Prereg is time-consumming (before data collection/analysis) but increase credibility after
- VC : Bert : prereg is not about the quality of the overall study
	- Prereg does not mean good science and does not solve all issues
- VD : Prereg does not impact curiosity
- VE : Prosper : as long as you tell it in the methods and have prior hypotheses
	- You still have methods and analyses that you can prereg
- VF : Tina, prereg has a timestamp so no worries about being scooped
	- An embargo keeps a prereg pricate until a specified date
