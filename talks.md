# 11.10.2022 - Cvetomir Dimov - An Integrated Model of Collaborative Skill Acquisition: Anticipation,Control Tuning, and Role Adoption

- Space Fortress
- ACT-R ([Anderson, 2007](https://www.amazon.com/Physical-Universe-Oxford-Cognitive-Architectures/dp/0195398955)) unified thepory of the mind

# 02.12.2022 - Swiss Reproducibility Network - Preregistration & Registered reports: how to improve the credibility and reproducibility of your research

- [Registered reports](https://cos.io/rr/) :
	- allow the method and the logic of the study to be peer-reviewed before execution
	- intro method data anlysis plan and submit stage 1 (3m) -> revision (2m) -> IPA received & data collection (2m) -> data analysis (3m) -> stage 2 (1m) -> published (3m)
- OSF to prereg + provide templates
- [OSFregistries](https://osf.io/registries) : search engine for prereg
- [aspredicted](https://aspredicted.org/) - prereg around 1-2 weeks to talk about it
- IPA : In-Principle-Acceptance
- VA : Sean because they would "typically exclude these responses" - say in the analysis that they forgot while reporting reasons why to exclude the answers
	- Prereg is not a prison - one can deviate, as long as this is clearly explained in the manuscript
- VB : Mei, as you said earlier, pre-reg does not take more time than a typical reg -
	- Prereg is time-consumming (before data collection/analysis) but increase credibility after
- VC : Bert : prereg is not about the quality of the overall study
	- Prereg does not mean good science and does not solve all issues
- VD : Prereg does not impact curiosity
- VE : Prosper : as long as you tell it in the methods and have prior hypotheses
	- You still have methods and analyses that you can prereg
- VF : Tina, prereg has a timestamp so no worries about being scooped
	- An embargo keeps a prereg pricate until a specified date

# 08.12.2022 - Chandramallika Basak - Brain-Based Mechanisms of Cognitive Enhancemeents in Aing: Benefits of Computerized Training

- Age-related changes in cognition and brain :
	- Declines in :
		- Processing speed, WM, EF, LTM episodic, Gf (Park & Bischoff, 2010)
		- Gray matter volume (GM) in FP cortices, hippocampus (decline more shallo, more unique, may be sign of pre-dimensia)  and cerebellum (Raz N et al., 2005)
		- White matter (WM) (Qin et al., 2016)
- Alzheimer's disease :
	- 48M gloablly
	- characterized by cognitive and behavioral deficits involving some form of permanenet brain damarge
	- AD - most common form dementia (50% of OA over 80 have AD). Progressive, degenerate and fatal
	- Neurological changes in AD :
		- Neurofibrillary tangles, which destroy vital cell transport system made of proteins (Tau)
		- Plaques consisting of a core beta-amyloid, a protein, surrounded by degenerated fragmentets of dyins or dead neurons
		- Rapid death of neurons due to lack of nutrients
	- Compression of morbidity
- How can we improve broad cognitive abilities in older adultes : *cognitive flexbility* (through WM)
- What are the best strategies to offset CA : *strategic optimization* (inter-ind differences)
- Basak, C., Qin, S., & O'Connell, M. A. (2020). Differential effects of cognitive training modules in healthy aging and mild cognitive impairment: A comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.Psychology and Aging, 35(2), 220â€“249. https://doi.org/10.1037/pag0000442 :
	- No diff bw active and passive control group
	- Effet of cog training in Healthy Adults (HA) : .27, and .28 for Mild Cogntiive Impairment (MCI)
	- For single component training : near trans sig* across reasong, proc speed, EF, epidosic memory (Fig.3)
	- Multi comp had near AND far including VG training (engagement) (Fig. 4)
- Miyake et al., 2000 : switch, inhibition, updating

	- Better EF training task for far transfer
- [O'Connell & Basak (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393218301544) :
	- Link bw fronto parietal et Default Mode Network
- Basak & Skolasinka :
	- FP : greater d' does not predict RT, but RT less varaible
- Physical activity and brain function during MM :
	- Quin & Basak, 2020, 2022 :
		- Task-switching paradigm : The combined effects of 2 cardiovascular risk factos is greater than effects of 1 risk factor on maladaptive overactivations
