## Mastering the Vim Language

25 sept. 2022

Notes taken from : [Mastering the Vim Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlR5gYd6um0), [slides](https://ctoomey.com/mastering-the-vim-language-slides.pdf)

- [Typing is not the bottleneck](http://anarchycreek.com/2009/05/26/how-tdd-and-pairing-increase-production/) : "the hard part of programming is thinking" - increase productivity in your team 1) writing a microtest that fails before you change any code, 2) adopt a "no-pair no-keep" agreement, 3) establish a shared understanding of code quality. What will slow you down is every flawed decision.
- power of `.`, `c`, `i[wt"p]`, `f`, `t` (cf. https://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language , https://blog.carbonfive.com/vim-text-objects-the-definitive-guide/ , https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1 , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118 )

## Why should you use a basic text editor?

08 sept. 2022

I will mostly focus on vim since I have been using this since the beginning

**Why should you use [vim](https://www.vim.org/) ?**

1. Keep it classy
2. Way more efficient (and less memory consumming !) than those fancy apps (*e.g.*, VSC, BrainJet, Atom,...)
3. Impress your peers

**How to begin your programming journey?**

1. Learn the basics
   - Open a terminal and execute the command [vimtutor](https://vimschool.netlify.app/introduction/vimtutor/)
2. Make it appealing to you
   - Configure your [.vimrc file](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vimrc-configuration-guide-customize-your-vim-editor/)
3. Keep track of your learning
   - Take notes using [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) and allow yourself to build a [secondbrain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com) !
