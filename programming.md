## Why should you use a basic text editor?

08 sept. 2022

I will mostly focus on vim since I have been using this since the beginning

**Why should you use [vim](https://www.vim.org/) ?**

1. Keep it classy
2. Way more efficient (and less memory consumming !) than those fancy apps (*e.g.*, VSC, BrainJet, Atom,...)
3. Impress your peers

**How to begin your programming journey?**

1. Learn the basics
   - Open a terminal and execute the command [vimtutor](https://vimschool.netlify.app/introduction/vimtutor/)
2. Make it appealing to you
   - Configure your [.vimrc file](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vimrc-configuration-guide-customize-your-vim-editor/)
3. Keep track of your learning
   - Take notes using [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) and allow yourself to build a [secondbrain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com) !
