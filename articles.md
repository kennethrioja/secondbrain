**Notes**
- "The future success of End-User Development depends on creating tools that end users are motivated to learn and use in daily work practices.
- EUD range from customization to component configuration and programming.
- EUD balances between user motivation, effective tools, and management support.
- EUD ideal : high scope/low cost learning -> providing graphical worlds to create programmable agents that still impose a learning burden of instructing agents with condition-action rules, adn designing agent models.
- User motivation should be encouraged during the early stages of adoption by management support, training, and task forces to spread best practice and expertise.
- Constructive support and training fosters success, encourages responsibnility and enables management to control by leadership.
- In a culture of high end-user motivation and low managerial influence, success is simply a matter of users taking development into their own hands => *a culture of cooperation shares the responsibility for developing accurate and effective solutions.
- **Meta-design** characteirzes objectives, techniques, and processes for creating new media and environments allowing "owners of problems"/end-users to act as designers.
    - Fundamental objective : to create socio-technical environments that empower users to engage actively in the continuous dev of systems rather than being restricted to the use of existing systems
    - *design time and use time* : orignally system dev create the environments and tools, users find them unfit, thus requiring modification.
        - *underdesign* is the meta-design approach : defining activity to create designe space for others, it aims to provide social and technical instruments for the owners of problems to create the solution themselves at use time.
    - MD include users in an ongoing development process as co-designers thoughout the entire existence of the system.
    - MD provides users with opportunities, tools and social structures to extend the system to fit their needs.
    - MD transcends user-centered and participatory design by changing the processes by which systems and content are designed
        - *shifting control* from designers to users to empower them to create and contribute their own visions and objectves.
        - *designing the design process* is promoted to a 1st-class activity = technical and social conditions are as important as creating the artifact itself => enables conditions for collaborative design in which all participants incrementally acquire ownership of problems and contribute actively to their solutions.
    - **Seeding, Evolutionary growth and Reseeding (SER) process model** : 
        - encourage designers to coneptualize their activity as meta-design, thereby supporting users as designers rather than restricting them to passive consummers
        - *social creativity* : all stakeholders reach a shared understanding by contributing their different POV and knowledge
        - *open source* : designers provide a seed that can be evolved by users at use time. Users are seen as co-designers by :
            - actively soliciting and incorportaing user contributions,
            - sharing the control over users by grnting full and direct access to source code,
            - promoting mutual learning among community members through mailing lists,
            - deliberately fostering a reward and recognition struture that motivates active participation by explicitly knowledging and promoting contributors
            - => open source in MD have a lower cost for each user because the dev cost is distirbuted among a large number of pp and ind contributions are shared.
        - *interactive art* : focuses on participation and collaboration as forms of co-creation, in which users become co-dev of artwork.
            - interaction by giving the tools to the users, seen as the real object of creative production
            - MD environments not only allow users to create content, but also modify the behavior and components of the system at use time through interaction
- "MD is more than a technical problem; it must address the challenges of creating new mindsets, new sources of creativity, cultural changes, and innovative societies. It has the potential to create a culture in which all participants in collaborative design processes can express themselves and engage in personally meaningful activities."

**THM** : The designer's role in one team during co-conception is to let other's creativity emerge, to do that, he needs to take a step back, not thinking about the product's expected qualities, but aiming at a 'user-designed' product.

**Authors** : Yann Le Guennec

**Tags** : :meta-design: :user-centered-design:

**Notes**
- Design d'expérience : conception de systèmes d'interactions entre les acteurs et les processus.
- Tâche du designer : qualifier la durée de l'expérience et tenter de lui donner un sens, un pouvoir de modification des états des acteurs
- La conception des systèmes d'interaction cherche à mettre en évidence un certain nombre de bànàfices pour ses acteurs.
- Utilisateurs sont acteurs au même titre que Concepteurs + Design centré utilisateur
    - = **meta-design** : "Le métadesign caractérise les objectifs, les techniques et les processus pour créer de nouveaux moyens d’expression et des environnements qui permettent aux possesseurs d’un problème d’agir en designers." ([Fischer, 2003](http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~gerhard/papers/hci2003-meta-design.pdf)
- Le rôle du designer réside dans le fait de permettre et favoriser l'émergence du dispositif de méta-conception - s'effacer pour laisser apparaître la créativité et les intentions de l'ensemble des acteurs du système = nécessité d'effacement = initialisation d'un processus de métadesign.
- Objectif personnel de participer à l'élaboration d'une sollution qui soit la plus satisfaisante possible pour les acteurs auxquels cette solution est destinée.
- Processus global commence par la formulation des bénéfices attendus et la fluidification des rôles des acteurs + fondé sur l'acceptation du désir humain d'une évolution qui passe par la transformation de son environnement,
- Questions :
    - désir de quoi? -> bénéfices attendus et donc les objectifs
    - responsables comment? -> manière d'y accéder, pertinence de ces objectifs et les outils méthodologiques qu'ils impliquent.


## [Meri et al., 2022 : Higher access to screens is related to decreased functional connectivity between neural networks associated with basic attention skills and cognitive control in children](https://doi.org/10.1080/09297049.2022.2110577?link_credit=KennethRioja)

**THM** : Importance of child-parent interaction during screen exposure, even at 8-12 yo, associated with better cognitive abilities - may allow a better error monitoring, leading to better learning patterns.

**Authors** : Raya Meri, John Hutton, Rola Farah, Mark DiFrancesco, Leonid Gozman & Tzipi Horowitz-Kraus

**Tags** : :children: :neurobiology: :screen: :cognitive: :child-parent-interaction:

**Abstract** : Screen-based media has become a prevailing part of children’s lives. Different technologies provide limitless access to a wide range of content. This accessibility has immensely increased screen exposure among children, showing that this exposure is associated with decreased cognitive abilities. This study was designed to evaluate how the neurobiological correlates for different sub-components of screen exposure, such as level of access, content, and frequency, are related to different cognitive abilities. Resting-state functional MRI data were collected in 29 native English-speaking children (8–12 years old), in addition to cognitive-behavioral measures. Functional connectivity measures within and between several networks related to cognitive control and attention were calculated [fronto-parietal (FP), cingulo-opercular (CO), dorsal attention (DAN), ventral attention (VAN), salience, default mode (DMN), cerebellar networks]. Sub-components of screen exposure were measured using the Screen-Q questionnaire. Higher access to screens was related to lower functional connectivity between neural networks associated with basic attention skills and cognitive control (i.e., DAN and salience). In addition, higher levels of parent-child interaction during screen exposure were related to increased functional connectivity between networks related to cognitive control and learning (i.e., CO and cerebellar). These findings suggest that screen exposure may reduce the engagement of basic attention and modulation of cognitive control networks and that higher levels of parent-child interaction engage cognitive control networks. An enhanced understanding of these processes can provide an important scientific basis for future educational and medical approaches regarding screen exposure.

**Notes**
- ? exposure associated with decreased cognitive abilities in children
- ? this study was designed to evaluate how the neurobiological correlates for diff sub-components of screen exposure (level of access, content and freq)
- American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations, children > 2yo can consume 1-2 hours/day of screen
- Screen exposure *associated* with obesity, language delays, attention problems and deterioration of cog abilities
- if too much screen time, reduced parent-child interaction
> RQ: explore the relations between the type of screen exposure (level of access, content, frequency, and parent-child interaction)
- n=29, 8-12 yo, no diff av. household income or maternal lvl of ed.
- screen content (non-violent, slow pace, from ScreenQ, answered by parents) x WM (digit span, WISC) : **r = .4**
- dialogue (parent-child interaction and co-viewing) x Speed of Processing (subtest of symbol seatch WISC) : **r = -.41**
> Overall, higher screen access measure was related to decreased functional connectivity between networks related to attention and modulation of cognitive control, and increased functional connectivity between networks related to cognitive control and learning was associated with lower screen dialogue measure.

**Comments**
- the screen content items are indicated as difficult for parents to answer for their children probably due to the young age of children () and/or social desirability bias ([Hutton et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-0765-1?link_credit=KennethRioja))
- the screen content subscale ranges from 0-5, 0 is no violent media + child never dl apps + talk/sing media VS. 5 is often violent media + often child dl apps + fast more action

**THM** : AVG effects = improved inhibition (stroop), flexibility (WCST, only "3D group"), but no effect on continuous attention.

**Abstract** : In recent years, interest in digital games has grown significantly and at the same time a range of games in 2D and 3D has been created. While 2D games cannot give depth to objects, 3D games creates spatial depth. The growth of the gaming industry has raised concerns among some psychologists. There is still much controversy about positive or negative effects of these games on cognitive performance. Executive functions are a set of cognitive abilities that play a decisive role in one’s purposeful behavior. The present study aims to investigate the effect of 2D and 3D video games on some of these functions—flexibility, inhibition, and continuous attention—in male students aged 18–26 years. Forty-five male students at Persian Gulf University participated in the study. They were matched based on intelligence score and experience of playing video games. The participants were divided into three groups of 15 (two experimental groups and one control group). Participants in the two experimental groups played 2D and 3D video games over 20 sessions. They completed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, continuous performance test, Stroop test, and Raven intelligence test. Data were analyzed via covariance and the results showed that playing 2D and 3D video games positively and significantly affects inhibition and playing 3D games has a significant positive effect on flexibility. Based on our findings, we discuss the different effects of 2D and 3D video games, in line with the study’s theoretical framework, and give suggestions for future studies.

**Notes**
- study focuses on effect of AVG on EF + compares 2D vs 3D (=creating depth) games
- VD : inhibition (stroop), flexibility (WCST), continuous attention (CPT)
- training : no NVGP, only even distribution of IQ and VG xp, males 18-26yo, 15/group, 20min/d, 5d/w, 4w 
- 2D group ("cannot give depth to object") vs. 3D group ("stereoscopic 3D games (...) creating spatial depth, so objects appear closer to the player and seem touchable")  vs. passive control group

**Abstract** : In this article we argue that to study or apply games as learning environments, multiple perspectives have to be taken into account. We first define game-based learning and gamification, and then discuss theoretical models that describe learning with games, arguing that playfulness is orthogonal to learning theory. We then review design elements of games that facilitate learning by fostering learners' cognitive, behavioral, affective, and sociocultural engagement with the subject matter. Finally, we discuss the basis of these design elements in cognitive, motivational, affective, and sociocultural foundations by reviewing key theories from education and psychology that are the most pertinent to game-based learning and by describing empirical research on learning with games that has been or should be conducted. We conclude that a combination of cognitive, motivational, affective, and sociocultural perspectives is necessary for both game design and game research to fully capture what games have to offer for learning.

- Game-based learning = type of game play with defined learning outcomes ([Shaffer et al., 2005](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED497016.pdf)) + balance the need to cover the subject matter with the desire to prioritize game play ([Plass et al., 2010](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1012682/The-Games-for-Learning-Institute))

**Abstract** :Cognitive decline because of aging and neurodegeneration has become increasingly prevalent. This calls for the implementation of efficacious, motivating, standardized and widely available cognitive interventions for the elderly. In this context, serious video games and virtual reality may represent promising approaches. Here, we review recent research on their potential for cognitive prevention and neurorehabilitation of age-related cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The majority of currently available data in this evolving domain lacks the methodological quality to draw reliable conclusions on the potential of novel technology for cognitive training in older people. However, single well designed randomized controlled trials have reported promising effects of cognitive interventions involving serious video games and virtual reality. The cognitive benefits of exergames promoting physical exercise with and without combined cognitive training remain unclear. The immersion into stimulating and motivating environments along with training content based on neuroscientific and neuropsychological models may represent a significant advance as compared with conventional computerized cognitive training. Additional research with sound methodology including sufficient sample sizes, active control groups and meaningful outcome measures of everyday function is needed to elucidate the potential of serious video games and virtual reality in multifactorial neurorehabilitation of cognitive decline in aging and neurodegeneration.
