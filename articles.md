**THM** : Importance of child-parent interaction during screen exposure, even at 8-12 yo, associated with better cognitive abilities - may allow a better error monitoring, leading to better learning patterns.

**Abstract** : Screen-based media has become a prevailing part of children’s lives. Different technologies provide limitless access to a wide range of content. This accessibility has immensely increased screen exposure among children, showing that this exposure is associated with decreased cognitive abilities. This study was designed to evaluate how the neurobiological correlates for different sub-components of screen exposure, such as level of access, content, and frequency, are related to different cognitive abilities. Resting-state functional MRI data were collected in 29 native English-speaking children (8–12 years old), in addition to cognitive-behavioral measures. Functional connectivity measures within and between several networks related to cognitive control and attention were calculated [fronto-parietal (FP), cingulo-opercular (CO), dorsal attention (DAN), ventral attention (VAN), salience, default mode (DMN), cerebellar networks]. Sub-components of screen exposure were measured using the Screen-Q questionnaire. Higher access to screens was related to lower functional connectivity between neural networks associated with basic attention skills and cognitive control (i.e., DAN and salience). In addition, higher levels of parent-child interaction during screen exposure were related to increased functional connectivity between networks related to cognitive control and learning (i.e., CO and cerebellar). These findings suggest that screen exposure may reduce the engagement of basic attention and modulation of cognitive control networks and that higher levels of parent-child interaction engage cognitive control networks. An enhanced understanding of these processes can provide an important scientific basis for future educational and medical approaches regarding screen exposure.

**Notes**
- ? exposure associated with decreased cognitive abilities in children
- ? this study was designed to evaluate how the neurobiological correlates for diff sub-components of screen exposure (level of access, content and freq)
- American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations, children > 2yo can consume 1-2 hours/day of screen
- Screen exposure *associated* with obesity, language delays, attention problems and deterioration of cog abilities
- if too much screen time, reduced parent-child interaction
> RQ: explore the relations between the type of screen exposure (level of access, content, frequency, and parent-child interaction)
- n=29, 8-12 yo, no diff av. household income or maternal lvl of ed.
- screen content (non-violent, slow pace, from ScreenQ, answered by parents) x WM (digit span, WISC) : **r = .4**
- dialogue (parent-child interaction and co-viewing) x Speed of Processing (subtest of symbol seatch WISC) : **r = -.41**
> Overall, higher screen access measure was related to decreased functional connectivity between networks related to attention and modulation of cognitive control, and increased functional connectivity between networks related to cognitive control and learning was associated with lower screen dialogue measure.

**Comments**
- the screen content items are indicated as difficult for parents to answer for their children probably due to the young age of children () and/or social desirability bias ([Hutton et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-0765-1?link_credit=KennethRioja))
- the screen content subscale ranges from 0-5, 0 is no violent media + child never dl apps + talk/sing media VS. 5 is often violent media + often child dl apps + fast more action

## [Hoseini et al., 2022 : The Effect of 2D and 3D Action Video Game Interventions on Executive Functions in Male Students](https://doi.org/10.1177/10468781221110577?link_credit=KennethRioja)

**THM** : AVG effects = improved inhibition (stroop), flexibility (WCST, only "3D group"), but no effect on continuous attention.

**Abstract** : In recent years, interest in digital games has grown significantly and at the same time a range of games in 2D and 3D has been created. While 2D games cannot give depth to objects, 3D games creates spatial depth. The growth of the gaming industry has raised concerns among some psychologists. There is still much controversy about positive or negative effects of these games on cognitive performance. Executive functions are a set of cognitive abilities that play a decisive role in one’s purposeful behavior. The present study aims to investigate the effect of 2D and 3D video games on some of these functions—flexibility, inhibition, and continuous attention—in male students aged 18–26 years. Forty-five male students at Persian Gulf University participated in the study. They were matched based on intelligence score and experience of playing video games. The participants were divided into three groups of 15 (two experimental groups and one control group). Participants in the two experimental groups played 2D and 3D video games over 20 sessions. They completed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, continuous performance test, Stroop test, and Raven intelligence test. Data were analyzed via covariance and the results showed that playing 2D and 3D video games positively and significantly affects inhibition and playing 3D games has a significant positive effect on flexibility. Based on our findings, we discuss the different effects of 2D and 3D video games, in line with the study’s theoretical framework, and give suggestions for future studies.

**Notes**
- study focuses on effect of AVG on EF + compares 2D vs 3D (=creating depth) games
- VD : inhibition (stroop), flexibility (WCST), continuous attention (CPT)
- training : no NVGP, only even distribution of IQ and VG xp, males 18-26yo, 15/group, 20min/d, 5d/w, 4w 
- 2D group ("cannot give depth to object") vs. 3D group ("stereoscopic 3D games (...) creating spatial depth, so objects appear closer to the player and seem touchable")  vs. passive control group

**Comments**
- 2D (uncharted drake's fortune) and 3D (uncharted drake's deception) groups are trained on '3D' games...

**Abstract** : In this article we argue that to study or apply games as learning environments, multiple perspectives have to be taken into account. We first define game-based learning and gamification, and then discuss theoretical models that describe learning with games, arguing that playfulness is orthogonal to learning theory. We then review design elements of games that facilitate learning by fostering learners' cognitive, behavioral, affective, and sociocultural engagement with the subject matter. Finally, we discuss the basis of these design elements in cognitive, motivational, affective, and sociocultural foundations by reviewing key theories from education and psychology that are the most pertinent to game-based learning and by describing empirical research on learning with games that has been or should be conducted. We conclude that a combination of cognitive, motivational, affective, and sociocultural perspectives is necessary for both game design and game research to fully capture what games have to offer for learning.
