**Abstract** : Despite the increased interest in gamification approaches, there is a lack of comparative studies that shed light on the applicability of these approaches in educational contexts. In this explorative study, with an experimental design, university learners (N = 98) studied a complex process (i.e., how to brew beer) in a 2-hour-long computerized simulation. In the experimental condition, the simulation featured the following game design elements: game goals, increased freedom of choice, points, virtual currency, and praise (i.e., a gamified simulation). These elements were absent in the simulation versions used in the two control conditions. No differences in learning outcomes and intrinsic motivation variables between the gamified simulation and its nongamified versions were observed. The gamified simulation was perceived to be significantly easier than the nongamified versions (η2p = 0.10; d = 0.74, 0.42). Of the game elements used in this study, the participants perceived most positively a clear, game-like goal. The findings are consistent with self-determination theory, cognitive-affective theory of learning from media, and cognitive load theory. The findings also support the emerging notion that caution should be applied when using gamification approaches in educational contexts.

**Notes**
- Intro : 
    - *edu-gamification* : points, achievement badges and leaderboards; clear, game-like goals, and increased challenges; narratives; increased freedom of choice; and immediate feedback ([Darejeh & Salim, 2016](#darejeh--salim-2016--gamification-solutions-to-enhance-software-user-engagementa-systematic-review), [Dicheva et al., 2015](#dicheva-et-al-2015--gamification-in-education-a-systematic-mapping-study))
    - gamification puts emphasis only on the individual elements of games
    - PB : the alledged claims are not well supported by solid empirical evidence ([Ortiz-Rojas et al., 2017](#ortiz-rojas-et-al-2017--gaemification-and-learning-performance-a-systematic-review-of-the-literature)) + lack of information about which added game design elements are + or - in edu settings
    - explorative experimental study of whether a common edu-gamification approach can improve learning using a stand-alone computer simulation of a non-Information and Communication Technology topic
    - focus on game-like goal, points, increased freedom of choice, and praise that provides immediate feedback
    - Edu-Gamification Studies With Comparative Design :
        - badges and/or points with leaderboards *sometimes increase participation* in various activities or *improve students' time management* (see refs in article)
        - Hanus and Fox (2015), used badges, coins and leaderboard and found *no improvements on grades and sfrp class effort*.
        - 3 studies for ICT courses showed competition-driven gamified course version (ST goals, trophies, badges and leaderboard) helped complete homework assignments but 3/4 of pp rarely or never used gamified add-ons (see refs in article) => *not everyone needs it*
        - Katz et al. (2014) : achieved points not displayed showed best training perf + when all game-based elements almost worst in terms of training perf
    - Digital Game-Based Learning studies :
        - to assess the effect of individual game elements but inconclusive and conflicting results regarding the presence of ompetitive elements in edu games (see refs in article)
    - Seductive Details : 
        - *do not improve learning in general* (see refs) except presence of a narrative in game-based context beneficial for 10-yo children
    - Theoretical Standpoints : 
        - **Self-Determination Theory** (Deci & Ryan, 1985) : *Competence, Relatedness, Autonomy* 
            - expected tangible rewards may redzce the perception of autonomy
        - & **Intrinsic motivation** (Ryan & Deci, 2000) => doing an activity for its own sake because it is inherently interesting and enjoyable
        - -(+)-> **Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning from Media** (CATLM, Moreno, 2005) and affective-motivational factors => "motivating and engaging"
        - while **Cognitive load theory** (Sweller et al., 2011) => most gamification methods are distracting; some can ease cognitive processing
            - segmenting of learning can reduce cognitive load

- This study :
    - Game elements under investigation : 1) clear game goal; 2) increased feedom in choice of tasks to work on; 3) points/money given for doing well; 4) verbal rewards in the form of praise with some learning-related information

**Abstract** : Gamification is the use of video-game mechanics and elements in nongame contexts to enhance user engagement and performance. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review to have an in-depth investigation into the existing gamification solutions targeted at solving user engagement problems in different categories of software. We carried out this systematic review by proposing a framework of gamifying process, which is the basis for comparison of existing gamification solutions. In order to report the review, the primary studies are categorized according to the following: a) gamified software and their platforms; b) elements of the gamifying process; c) gamification solutions in each software type; d) gamification solutions for software user engagement problems; e) gamification solutions in general; and f) effects of gamification on software user engagement and performance. Based on the search procedure and criteria, a total of 78 primary studies were extracted. Most of the studies focused on educational and social software, which were developed for web or mobile platforms. We concluded that the number of studies on motivating users to use software content, solving problems in learning software, and using real identity is very limited. Furthermore, few studies have been carried out on gamifying the following software categories: productivity software, cloud storage, utility software, entertainment software, search engine software, tool software, fitness software, software engineering, information worker software, and health-care software. In addition, a large number of gamification solutions are relatively simple and require improvement. Thus, for future studies, researchers can work on the items discovered in this review; they can improve the quality of the current gamified systems by using a wide variety of game mechanics and interface elements, utilizing a combination of contextual types of rewards and giving users the ability to use received rewards “in-game” and “out-game.”

## [Deterding et al., From game design elements to gamefulness: defining "gamification"](https://doi.org/10.1145/2181037.2181040)

**THM** : MAIN DEFINITION OF GAMIFICATION : "Gamification is the *use of game desgin elements in non-game contexts*.

**Authors** :Sebastian Deterding, Dan Dixon, Rilla Khaled, Lennart Nacke

**Tags** : :gamification: :definition:

**Abstract** : Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.

**THM** : MD seeks to empower end-users by giving them the tools and opportunities to act on the product as soon as possible while being part of the dev team on equal terms with every other actor 

**Authors** : G. Fischer, E. Giaccardi, Y. Ye, A. G. Sutcliffe , N. Mehandjiev

**Tags** : :meta-design: :end-user-development:

**Notes**
- "The future success of End-User Development depends on creating tools that end users are motivated to learn and use in daily work practices.
- EUD ideal : high scope/low cost learning -> providing graphical worlds to create programmable agents that still impose a learning burden of instructing agents with condition-action rules, and designing agent models.
- User motivation should be encouraged during the early stages of adoption by management support, training, and task forces to spread best practice and expertise.
- Constructive support and training fosters success, encourages responsibility and enables management to control by leadership.
- In a culture of high end-user motivation and low managerial influence, success is simply a matter of users taking development into their own hands => *a culture of cooperation shares the responsibility for developing accurate and effective solutions.*
- **Meta-design** characteirzes objectives, techniques, and processes for creating new media and environments allowing "owners of problems"/end-users to act as designers.
    - Fundamental objective : to create socio-technical environments that empower users to engage actively in the continuous dev of systems rather than being restricted to the use of existing systems
    - *Design time and use time* : orignally system dev create the environments and tools, users find them unfit, thus requiring modification.
        - *Underdesign* is the meta-design approach : defining activity to create design space for others, it aims to provide social and technical instruments for the owners of problems to create the solution themselves at use time.
    - MD include users in an ongoing development process as co-designers thoughout the entire existence of the system.
    - MD provides users with opportunities, tools and social structures to extend the system to fit their needs.
    - MD transcends user-centered and participatory design by changing the processes by which systems and content are designed
        - *Shifting control* from designers to users to empower them to create and contribute their own visions and objectves.
        - *Designing the design process* is promoted to a 1st-class activity = technical and social conditions are as important as creating the artifact itself => enables conditions for collaborative design in which all participants incrementally acquire ownership of problems and contribute actively to their solutions.
    - **Seeding, Evolutionary growth and Reseeding (SER) process model** : 
        - Encourage designers to coneptualize their activity as meta-design, thereby supporting users as designers rather than restricting them to passive consumers
        - *Social creativity* : all stakeholders reach a shared understanding by contributing their different POV and knowledge
        - *Open source* : designers provide a seed that can be evolved by users at use time. Users are seen as co-designers by :
            - Actively soliciting and incorportaing user contributions,
            - Sharing the control over users by grnting full and direct access to source code,
            - Promoting mutual learning among community members through mailing lists,
            - Deliberately fostering a reward and recognition struture that motivates active participation by explicitly knowledging and promoting contributors
            - => Open source in MD have a lower cost for each user because the dev cost is distirbuted among a large number of pp and ind contributions are shared.
        - *Interactive art* : focuses on participation and collaboration as forms of co-creation, in which users become co-dev of artwork.
            - Interaction by giving the tools to the users, seen as the real object of creative production
            - MD environments not only allow users to create content, but also modify the behavior and components of the system at use time through interaction
- "MD is more than a technical problem; it must address the challenges of creating new mindsets, new sources of creativity, cultural changes, and innovative societies. It has the potential to create a culture in which all participants in collaborative design processes can express themselves and engage in personally meaningful activities."

**Notes**
- Design d'expérience : conception de systèmes d'interactions entre les acteurs et les processus.
- Tâche du designer : qualifier la durée de l'expérience et tenter de lui donner un sens, un pouvoir de modification des états des acteurs
- La conception des systèmes d'interaction cherche à mettre en évidence un certain nombre de bénéfices pour ses acteurs.
- Utilisateurs sont acteurs au même titre que Concepteurs + Design centré utilisateur

- Le rôle du designer réside dans le fait de permettre et favoriser l'émergence du dispositif de méta-conception - s'effacer pour laisser apparaître la créativité et les intentions de l'ensemble des acteurs du système = nécessité d'effacement = initialisation d'un processus de métadesign.
- Objectif personnel de participer à l'élaboration d'une sollution qui soit la plus satisfaisante possible pour les acteurs auxquels cette solution est destinée.
- Processus global commence par la formulation des bénéfices attendus et la fluidification des rôles des acteurs + fondé sur l'acceptation du désir humain d'une évolution qui passe par la transformation de son environnement,
- Questions :
    - désir de quoi? -> bénéfices attendus et donc les objectifs
    - responsables comment? -> manière d'y accéder, pertinence de ces objectifs et les outils méthodologiques qu'ils impliquent.


## [Meri et al., 2022 : Higher access to screens is related to decreased functional connectivity between neural networks associated with basic attention skills and cognitive control in children](https://doi.org/10.1080/09297049.2022.2110577?link_credit=KennethRioja)

**THM** : Importance of child-parent interaction during screen exposure, even at 8-12 yo, associated with better cognitive abilities - may allow a better error monitoring, leading to better learning patterns.

**Authors** : Raya Meri, John Hutton, Rola Farah, Mark DiFrancesco, Leonid Gozman & Tzipi Horowitz-Kraus

**Tags** : :children: :neurobiology: :screen: :cognitive: :child-parent-interaction:

**Abstract** : Screen-based media has become a prevailing part of children’s lives. Different technologies provide limitless access to a wide range of content. This accessibility has immensely increased screen exposure among children, showing that this exposure is associated with decreased cognitive abilities. This study was designed to evaluate how the neurobiological correlates for different sub-components of screen exposure, such as level of access, content, and frequency, are related to different cognitive abilities. Resting-state functional MRI data were collected in 29 native English-speaking children (8–12 years old), in addition to cognitive-behavioral measures. Functional connectivity measures within and between several networks related to cognitive control and attention were calculated [fronto-parietal (FP), cingulo-opercular (CO), dorsal attention (DAN), ventral attention (VAN), salience, default mode (DMN), cerebellar networks]. Sub-components of screen exposure were measured using the Screen-Q questionnaire. Higher access to screens was related to lower functional connectivity between neural networks associated with basic attention skills and cognitive control (i.e., DAN and salience). In addition, higher levels of parent-child interaction during screen exposure were related to increased functional connectivity between networks related to cognitive control and learning (i.e., CO and cerebellar). These findings suggest that screen exposure may reduce the engagement of basic attention and modulation of cognitive control networks and that higher levels of parent-child interaction engage cognitive control networks. An enhanced understanding of these processes can provide an important scientific basis for future educational and medical approaches regarding screen exposure.

**Notes**
- ? exposure associated with decreased cognitive abilities in children

> Overall, higher screen access measure was related to decreased functional connectivity between networks related to attention and modulation of cognitive control, and increased functional connectivity between networks related to cognitive control and learning was associated with lower screen dialogue measure.

**Comments**

**THM** : AVG effects = improved inhibition (stroop), flexibility (WCST, only "3D group"), but no effect on continuous attention.

**Authors** : Faride Sadat Hoseini, Masood Khodadadi, and Alireza Khorambakht

**Tags** : :AVG: :training: :intervention: :inhibition: :flexibility: :continuous-attention:

**Abstract** : In recent years, interest in digital games has grown significantly and at the same time a range of games in 2D and 3D has been created. While 2D games cannot give depth to objects, 3D games creates spatial depth. The growth of the gaming industry has raised concerns among some psychologists. There is still much controversy about positive or negative effects of these games on cognitive performance. Executive functions are a set of cognitive abilities that play a decisive role in one’s purposeful behavior. The present study aims to investigate the effect of 2D and 3D video games on some of these functions—flexibility, inhibition, and continuous attention—in male students aged 18–26 years. Forty-five male students at Persian Gulf University participated in the study. They were matched based on intelligence score and experience of playing video games. The participants were divided into three groups of 15 (two experimental groups and one control group). Participants in the two experimental groups played 2D and 3D video games over 20 sessions. They completed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, continuous performance test, Stroop test, and Raven intelligence test. Data were analyzed via covariance and the results showed that playing 2D and 3D video games positively and significantly affects inhibition and playing 3D games has a significant positive effect on flexibility. Based on our findings, we discuss the different effects of 2D and 3D video games, in line with the study’s theoretical framework, and give suggestions for future studies.

**Notes**
- study focuses on effect of AVG on EF + compares 2D vs 3D (=creating depth) games
- VD : inhibition (stroop), flexibility (WCST), continuous attention (CPT)
- training : no NVGP, only even distribution of IQ and VG xp, males 18-26yo, 15/group, 20min/d, 5d/w, 4w 
- 2D group ("cannot give depth to object") vs. 3D group ("stereoscopic 3D games (...) creating spatial depth, so objects appear closer to the player and seem touchable")  vs. passive control group

**Comments**
- 2D (uncharted drake's fortune) and 3D (uncharted drake's deception) groups are trained on '3D' games...

**Abstract** : Over the last 10 years, research on gamification, the use of game elements in non-game contexts, has increased in the field of education, due to its potential to enhance learning performance. Yet, the majority of available research rather focuses on the evaluation of motivation and engagement as key dependent variables. Hence, the purpose of this study is to review available studies on gamification, with an exclusive focus on learning performance as the key dependent variable. Through a systematic search and selection process, building on “Web of Science” articles and by considering studies between 2000 and 2016 related to gamification and learning, 582 articles were identified. Further inclusion and exclusion criteria, regarding setting (education), study focus (empirical), journal access (full access) and dependent variables (learning performance), resulted in a review of 23 articles meeting the criteria. The analysis of these articles showed how gamification could be linked to a direct increase in learning performance of students. Nevertheless, some studies also reflect weaker statistical differences between being involved or not in a gamified environment. The review analysis results are especially helpful to define a future agenda for gamification research, addressing the following gaps in the literature. First, include mediating and moderating variables to find more empirical research that can prove an indirect effect of gamification on learning performance. Second, carry out additional research that empirically underpins the direct linkage between gamification and learning performance. Third, include specific individual gamification elements to be able to determine explicit differential effects of these elements on learning performance. Fourth, conduct research in a broader range of knowledge fields to develop empirical evidence in the context of other knowledge domains next to computer sciences. Finally, consider involving larger sample and setting up longer experimental interventions, to avoid novelty effects and risks of lack of generalization.

**Authors** : Jan L. Plass, Bruce D. Homer & Charles K. Kinzer

**Abstract** : In this article we argue that to study or apply games as learning environments, multiple perspectives have to be taken into account. We first define game-based learning and gamification, and then discuss theoretical models that describe learning with games, arguing that playfulness is orthogonal to learning theory. We then review design elements of games that facilitate learning by fostering learners' cognitive, behavioral, affective, and sociocultural engagement with the subject matter. Finally, we discuss the basis of these design elements in cognitive, motivational, affective, and sociocultural foundations by reviewing key theories from education and psychology that are the most pertinent to game-based learning and by describing empirical research on learning with games that has been or should be conducted. We conclude that a combination of cognitive, motivational, affective, and sociocultural perspectives is necessary for both game design and game research to fully capture what games have to offer for learning.

**Abstract** :Cognitive decline because of aging and neurodegeneration has become increasingly prevalent. This calls for the implementation of efficacious, motivating, standardized and widely available cognitive interventions for the elderly. In this context, serious video games and virtual reality may represent promising approaches. Here, we review recent research on their potential for cognitive prevention and neurorehabilitation of age-related cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The majority of currently available data in this evolving domain lacks the methodological quality to draw reliable conclusions on the potential of novel technology for cognitive training in older people. However, single well designed randomized controlled trials have reported promising effects of cognitive interventions involving serious video games and virtual reality. The cognitive benefits of exergames promoting physical exercise with and without combined cognitive training remain unclear. The immersion into stimulating and motivating environments along with training content based on neuroscientific and neuropsychological models may represent a significant advance as compared with conventional computerized cognitive training. Additional research with sound methodology including sufficient sample sizes, active control groups and meaningful outcome measures of everyday function is needed to elucidate the potential of serious video games and virtual reality in multifactorial neurorehabilitation of cognitive decline in aging and neurodegeneration.
