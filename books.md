1. Introduction

- Challenges commonly encountered in games
    - Time and sequencing is important : have it done at right order at right time
    - Build rapidly without stepping on each other's toes or leaving footprints : github and clean code
    - Interactions in game must not add more difficulty : name each variable so that we can find them easily
    - Performance is critical in games : squeeze and be more efficient
- Architecture is about change : A "good software architecture" is when the entire program is crafted in anticipation of a change.
- "The measure of a design is how easily it accomodates changes"
