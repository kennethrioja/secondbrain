- Challenges commonly encountered in games
    1. Time and sequencing is important : have it done at right order at right time
    2. Build rapidly without stepping on each other's toes or leaving footprints : github and clean code
    3. Interactions in game must not add more difficulty : name each variable so that we can find them easily
    4. Performance is critical in games : squeeze and be more efficient
