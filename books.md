1. Introduction

- Challenges commonly encountered in games
    - Time and sequencing is important : have it done at right order at right time
    - Build rapidly without stepping on each other's toes or leaving footprints : github and clean code
    - Interactions in game must not add more difficulty : name each variable so that we can find them easily
    - Performance is critical in games : squeeze and be more efficient
- Architecture is about change : A "good software architecture" is when the entire program is crafted in anticipation of a change.
- "The measure of a design is how easily it accomodates changes"

# Making Games for Impact - Kirt Squire

- p.3 : "interactive entertainment technology or VG are now accepted as tools for learning (Squire, 2011), modes of persuasion (Bogost, 2007), and simply the expression of complex ideas and emotions"
- p.4 : "higher education institutions in particular are interested in diversifying income, but I will argue, they should leverage games todo what they do best: amplify the production of social and cultural capital for participants, rather than make money"
